    <h3>These twice-baked potatoes work perfectly as a simple, crowd-pleasing entr√©e or as a rich side dish!</h3>
    <p><em>The best potato variety for baking is low in moisture and high in starch, such as a Russet potato. Plus, they have sturdy skins (perfect for holding the rich filling) and are naturally perfectly portioned.</em></p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>4 large baking potatoes</li>
      <li>8 Slices of bacon</li>
      <li>1 cup of sour cream</li>
      <li>1/2 cup of milk</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons of butter</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons of salt</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon of pepper</li>
      <li>1 cup of shredded cheddar cheese, divided</li>
      <li>8 green onions, sliced, divided</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Bake potatoes in the preheated oven until tender, about 1 hour, depending on the size of your potatoes. Set potatoes aside until cool enough to handle.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium-high heat until evenly brown. Drain, crumble, and set aside</li>
        <li>Slice potatoes in half lengthwise and scoop the flesh into a large bowl; save skins. Add sour cream, milk, butter, salt, pepper, 1/2 cup cheese, and 1/2 of the green onions to the potato; mix with a hand mixer until well blended and creamy. Spoon the mixture into the potato skins; top each with remaining cheese, green onions, and bacon.</li>
        <li>Return potatoes to the preheated oven and continue baking until the cheese is melted, about 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Most importantly, ENJOY!!</li>
